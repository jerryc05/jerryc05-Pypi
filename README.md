## Installation

### Prerequisites

The following dependency is necessary:

-   **Python** 3.6+  (Either [CPython](https://www.python.org/downloads/) or [PyPy](<https://pypy.org/download.html>) works correctly)

### Option 1: Install via pip (recommended)

The official releases of `jerryc05` are distributed on [PyPI](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/jerryc05), and can be installed easily via the pip package manager.

Open `cmd.exe` or `powershell.exe` ![Win](<https://img.icons8.com/color/24/000000/windows8.png>) or `terminal` ![Mac](<https://img.icons8.com/color/24/000000/ubuntu.png>)/![Linux](<https://img.icons8.com/color/24/000000/mac-os.png>), and type:

```console
pip3 install jerryc05 -U
```

*Note*: Windows users might want to use command `python3` instead of`python`.

**For faster access from Mainland China**, you might want to use:

```console
pip3 install -i https://pypi.tuna.tsinghua.edu.cn/simple jerryc05 -U
```

### Option 2: Download from Online Repository

You can download the latest pre-release archive of `jerryc05` from [GitHub](https://github.com/jerryc05/jerryc05-PyPI/archive/master.zip), [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/jerryc05/jerryc05-PyPI/-/archive/master/jerryc05-PyPI-master.zip), or [Tencent Dev](<https://dev.tencent.com/u/jerryc05/p/jerryc05-PyPI/git/archive/master>). This option is for advanced users, and they know what to do. Therefore, no further instructions will be addressed here.

## How To Use

See GitHub pages from <https://jerryc05.github.io/jerryc05-PyPI/>.

## Contributing

### Option 1: Submit via GitHub Issue (recommended)

It is strongly encouraged to submit bug reports and feature requests through [GitHub Issue](https://github.com/jerryc05/jerryc05-PyPI/issues) page. It makes it easier for me to manage all requests in one place, and every issue is guaranteed to get a response.

**IMPORTANT!!!** Do not use issue pages in GitLab or Tencent Dev. It is a pain to maintain multiple separate issue pages, and your request will not get any response if you do so.

### Option 2: Contact Me via Direct Message Apps

This feature only applies to those who added me as their friend on QQ or WeChat; however, I still prefer to maintain issue together on [GitHub Issue](<https://github.com/jerryc05/jerryc05-PyPI/issues>) page.
